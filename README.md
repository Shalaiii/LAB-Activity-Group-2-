The GemillanTaskManager is a simple console application built in Java that demonstrates the use of a min-heap structure. It has a functions of a task priority manager, enabling users to organize and process tasks based on their urgency, with the lowest number being the most priority.

# FEATURES

This application helps users manage their tasks in a structured and efficient way. It can add tasks so that users can input tasks with associated priority values (lower values indicate higher priority). View Next Task that shows the task with the highest priority without removing it. Users can also indicate their task as complete in Complete Tasks and remove it from the queue.
Then, View All Tasks for a full list of tasks in the priority queue displayed for an overview of pending work. Lastly, Exit, which exited the program.

# WHY MAKE THIS APPLICATION AND HOW DOES IT CONTRIBUTE TO ME AND TO THE COMMUNITY

I developed this application to demonstrate a practical use case of heap structures, specifically the min-heap, in data structures and algorithms. It is designed to address real-life scenarios such as task management, where prioritization is crucial. Building this application refined my programming skills and enhanced my ability to create interactive console applications. It also serves as a simple, free tool for individuals to manage their tasks effectively without the need for complex software. Additionally, this program can help students and developers understand and apply heap structures in real-world problems.
